# Android UI testing Code Lab

The goal of this code lab is to recognize and try UI testing on Android platform. We develop couple of tests using Android's UI Automator and Espresso libraries as well as try some tools like Android test recorder and Monkey.

You will learn:

* how to write Android UI tests using UI Automator library
* how to write Android UI tests using Espresso library
* how to use Android test recorder
* how to use Monkey tool

Download the prepared project from Github and open it in Android studio. Everything important is prepared for you. Project is divided into parts according to this Code Lab.

## Part 1 - UI Automator
